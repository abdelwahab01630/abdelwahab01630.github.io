# Hackathon Project: Statistical Dashboard
## [National Institute of Statistics Rwanda Hackathon 2023 Edition](https://www.statistics.gov.rw/about-us/hackathon-competition-2023-edition)
![Dashboard Overview](https://github.com/Aksumite-Toumai/NISR-Hackathon/blob/main/demo_gif.gif)
### Team Name: [Aksumite-Toumai](https://github.com/Aksumite-Toumai)
### Institution: [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)](https://nexteinstein.org/)


### Project Description
Our project is part of the [National Institute of Statistics Rwanda (NISR) Hackathon 2023 Edition](https://www.statistics.gov.rw/about-us/hackathon-competition-2023-edition), which invites university students to visualize statistical messages published by [NISR](https://www.statistics.gov.rw/) through infographics and interactive dashboards. The overarching goal of this competition is to foster statistical literacy and promote data-driven decision-making.

In alignment with these objectives, our team has developed a dynamic and interactive dashboard using [Python](https://www.python.org/). This dashboard allows users to explore, analyze, and visualize statistical data provided by [NISR](https://www.statistics.gov.rw/) in an intuitive and user-friendly manner. Through this project, we aim to provide a platform that makes statistical data more accessible and understandable to a wider audience, thereby contributing to the increase of statistical literacy among the public.

We believe that by simplifying the representation of complex statistical data through our dashboard, we can provide valuable insights and promote a better understanding of the data published by [NISR](https://www.statistics.gov.rw/). Our project embodies the spirit of the hackathon by merging technology, design, and statistics to create a tool that encourages data exploration and education.
